#Live Search
This is a live-search using input field made without filter. 
I came accross a problem of needing to search in a JSON object using the same 
directory and looking for different values depending on what field is active.

It was tough but I think I overcame my issue, this is a working copy, please if you have suggestion, let me know they are more than welcome.
